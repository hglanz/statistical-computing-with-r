# PA 1: Using Data Visualization to Find the Penguins

## Multiple Categorical Variables

::: panel-tabset

## Colors & Shapes

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
#| label: student-code-step-8-shapes

ggplot(data = penguins) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species, shape = island )) + 
    labs(title = "Relashonship Between Bill Length and Bill Depth", x = "Bill Length (mm)" , y = "Bill Depth (mm)",)
```
:::

## Colors & Facets

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
#| label: student-code-step-8-facets

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm, 
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~island) +
  labs(x = "Bill Length",
       y = "", 
       title = "Changes in Bill Depth versus Length")
```
:::
:::

## Somethings I also noticed...

::: {.incremental}
- Code chunk options need to have a space before the option
(`#| label:` not `#|label:`).
- Make sure your code is visible (`echo: true`)!
- Make sure you remove the `messages` and `warnings` from your final document!  
:::

# Lab 1

## Grading / Feedback

::: {.small}
+ Each question will earn a score of "Success" or "Growing".
  * Questions marked "Growing" will receive feedback on how to improve your
  solution.
  * These questions can be resubmitted for additional feedback. 
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
+ Earning a "Success" doesn't necessarily mean your solution is without error.
  * You may still receive feedback on how to improve your solution.
  * These questions cannot be resubmitted for additional feedback.
:::

## Growing Points

::: {.incremental}
- Q2: **All** your code should be visible! 
- Q9: Captions should include more information than what is already present in
the plot!
- Q11: There's no need to save intermediate objects if they are never used later! 
:::

## How this translates into Lab 2...

::: {.incremental}
- Every lab and challenge is expected to use code-folding. 
- There should be no messages / warnings output in your final rendered HTML. 
- You should reduce the amount of "intermediate object junk" in your workspace. 
  + Ask yourself, do I need to use this later?
  + If the answer is no, then you should not save that object.

# Tidy Data

## Tidy Data

![Artwork by Allison Horst](https://cdn.myportfolio.com/45214904-6a61-4e23-98d6-b140f8654a40/85520b8f-4629-4763-8a2a-9ceff27458bf_rw_1920.jpg?h=21007b20ac00cf37318dca645c215453){fig-alt="An educational graphic explaining 'Tidy Data' with text and a simple table. The main text at the top reads, 'TIDY DATA is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure,' followed by the attribution to Hadley Wickham. Below, it explains the concept of tidy data: 'In tidy data: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, each cell is a single measurement.' To the right, there is a small table with three columns labeled 'id,' 'name,' and 'color,' demonstrating how each column is a variable and each row is an observation. The table contains entries such as 'floof' (gray), 'max' (black), and 'panda' (calico). The image ends with a citation for Hadley Wickham's 2014 paper on Tidy Data."}


## Same Data, Different Formats

Different formats of the data are **tidy** in different ways.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: creating-small-data-set-wide-format

bb_wide <- tibble(Team     = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                       Points   = c(88, 91, 99, 94),
                       Assists  = c(12, 17, 24, 28),
                       Rebounds = c(22, 28, 30, 31)
                       )
```

::: panel-tabset
### Option 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: displaying-wide-data

bb_wide |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

### Option 2

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: transforming-to-long

bb_long <- bb_wide |> 
  pivot_longer(cols      = c(Points, Assists, Rebounds),
               names_to  = "Statistic",
               values_to = "Value"
               )

bb_long |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Connection to ggplot

Let's make a plot of each team's statistics! 

::: panel-tabset
### Option 1 - Wide Data

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: plot-with-wide-data
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

       mapping = aes(x = Team)
       ) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = Points, 
                           color = "Points"), 
             size = 4) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = Assists, 
                           color = "Assists"), 
             size = 4) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = Rebounds, 
                           color = "Rebounds"), 
             size = 4) + 
  scale_colour_manual(
    values = c("darkred", "steelblue", "forestgreen")
  ) +
  labs(color = "Statistic")
```
:::

### Option 2 - Long Data

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: plot-with-long-data
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

In the center, there is a smiling blue rectangular character resembling a tidy data table, holding an ice cream cone. On either side of the table are two round, fluffy creatures: one pink on the left and one green on the right, both also holding ice cream cones. Above the characters, the text reads 'make friends with tidy data.' The overall tone of the image is friendly and inviting, encouraging positive feelings toward tidy data."}


# Working with External Data

## Common Types of Data Files

Look at the **file extension** for the type of data file.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

`.csv` :  "comma-separated values"

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```
Name, Age
Bob, 49
Joe, 40
```
:::

::::

. . .

`.xls`, `.xlsx`:  Microsoft Excel spreadsheet

  + Common approach: save as `.csv`
  + Nicer approach:  use the `readxl` package

. . .

`.txt`:  plain text

  + Could have any sort of delimiter...
  + Need to let R know what to look for!


## Common Types of Data Files

::: panel-tabset
### File A

![](images/csv_file.png)

### File B

+ [File C](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/24/quick-parse-csv-file.html)

:::


## Loading External Data

Using **base** `R` functions:

- `read.csv()` is for reading in `.csv` files.

- `read.table()` and `read.delim()` are for any data with "columns" (you specify the separator).


## Loading External Data

The **tidyverse** has some cleaned-up versions in the `readr` and `readxl` packages: 

::: {.small}
- `read_csv()` is for comma-separated data.

- `read_tsv()` is for tab-separated data.

- `read_table()` is for white-space-separated data.

- `read_delim()` is any data with "columns" (you specify the separator). The above are special cases.

- `read_xls()` and `read_xlsx()`  are specifically for dealing with Excel files.
:::

Remember to load the `readr` and `readxl` packages first!

# Graphics

# Graphics

+ **Structure:** boxplot, scatterplot, etc.

+ **Aesthetics:** features such as color, shape, and size that map other variables to structural features.

**Both** the structure and aesthetics should help viewers interpret the information.

# Pre-attentive Features

## Pre-attentive Features

<br>

The next slide will have one point that is not like the others.

<br>

Raise your hand when you notice it.

## Pre-attentive Features

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "A white background scattered with various green triangles and a single green circle. The triangles are evenly spaced but randomly oriented and positioned, with no apparent pattern or alignment. The single circle stands out among the triangles due to its different shape."

knitr::include_graphics("images/pre-atten1.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "A white background scattered with various red circles and a single green circle. The circles are evenly spaced but randomly oriented and positioned, with no apparent pattern or alignment. The single circle stands out among the other circles due to its different color."

knitr::include_graphics("images/pre-atten2.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features

> features that we see and perceive before we even think about it

+ They will jump out at us in less than 250 ms.

+ E.g., color, form, movement, spatial location.

. . .

There is a **hierarchy** of features:

+ Color is stronger than shape.
+ Combinations of pre-attentive features may **not** be pre-attentive due to interference.

## Gestalt Principles

Gestalt Hierarchy	| Graphical Feature
------------------| ------------------
1. Enclosure	    | Facets
2. Connection     |	Lines
3. Proximity	    | White Space
4. Similarity	    | Color/Shape

. . .

</br>

::: {.small}
Implications for practice:

+ Know that we perceive some groups before others.
+ Design to facilitate and emphasize the most important comparisons.

## Double Encoding

## No Double Encoding
```{r}

```

# [Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zALBl5f1ib4)

## Color

+ Color, hue, and intensity are pre-attentive features, and bigger contrasts lead to faster detection.
  + **Hue**: main color family (red, orange, yellow...)
  + **Intensity**: amount of color

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}

```{r}
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-alt: "This image is a color wheel that displays the concept of 'Hue.' The wheel is divided into 12 segments, each representing a different color. The colors transition smoothly around the wheel, moving from yellow to yellow-orange, orange, red-orange, red, red-violet, violet, blue-violet, blue, blue-green, green, and yellow-green. The word 'HUE' is written in the center of the wheel, indicating that the image is meant to illustrate the variety of hues that make up the color spectrum."
knitr::include_graphics("images/hue.png")
```

:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
  
```{r}
#| fig-alt: "This image illustrates the concept of color intensity. It shows a yellow square labeled 'YELLOW (HUE)' on the left, a gray square labeled 'GRAY' in the middle, and a square of desaturated yellow labeled 'LESS INTENSE' on the right. The image conveys that adding gray to a pure hue, such as yellow, results in a color that is less intense or more muted. The mathematical symbols '+' and '=' are used to show the combination of the yellow hue with gray, leading to a less intense color."

knitr::include_graphics("images/intensity.png")
```

## Color Guidelines

+ Do not use rainbow color gradients!

+ Be conscious of what certain colors “mean”.
  + Good idea to use red for "good" and green for "bad"?

::: columns
::: {.column width="44%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "This image is a color-coded map of Texas, showing the percentage of people in each county who identify as white. The map uses a rainbow gradient scale to represent different percentages: red and orange for lower percentages (0% to 25%), transitioning through yellow and green (around 50%), to blue and purple for higher percentages (75% to 100%). Each county in Texas is colored according to where it falls on this scale, indicating the variation in racial identification across the state. The legend at the bottom of the map clarifies the percentage range associated with each color."

knitr::include_graphics("images/rainbow.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "This image is a bar chart comparing the energy sources of six countries: Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Indonesia, and China. Each bar represents a country and is divided into two color-coded segments: red for 'Low-carbon sources' and green for 'Fossil fuels sources.' The chart shows the proportion of energy generated from each source in each country. The purpose of this image is not to demonstrate what fuels each country is using but to highlight how the graph uses red and green hues to separate the two types of fuel. Not only are these colors are difficult for some people's eyes to differentiate, but the plot has swapped what we would ordinarily think of as 'good' and 'bad' colors with fuels that are worse and better for the planet."

knitr::include_graphics("images/red_green.png")
```
:::
:::


## Color Guidelines
  
For **categorical** data, try not to use more than 7 colors:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 30%
#| fig-alt: "This image is a rectangular strip divided into seven equal vertical sections, each filled with a different solid color. The colors from left to right are: Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Orange, Yellow, Brown. Each section is distinctly separated by thin black lines, with no gradients or transitions between the colors. The image represents a simple color spectrum or palette."

knitr::include_graphics("images/small_gradient.png")
```

. . .

If you need to, you can use `colorRampPalette()` from the `RColorBrewer` package
to produce larger palettes:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "This image is a rectangular strip divided into 19 equal vertical sections, each filled with a different solid color. The colors from left to right are red, maroon, dark blue, teal, green, light green, gray, purple, dark maroon, orange, light orange, yellow, light yellow, gold, brown, pink, light pink, mauve, and light gray. Each section is distinctly separated by thin black lines, with no gradients or transitions between the colors. The image represents an extended color spectrum or palette with a nuanced range of colors."

knitr::include_graphics("images/big_gradient.png")
```


## Color Guidelines

+ For **quantitative** data, use mappings from data to color that are **numerically and perceptually uniform**.
  + Relative discriminability of two colors should be proportional to the difference between the corresponding data values.


## Color Guidelines

**To make your graphic color deficiency friendly...**
  
+ use **double encoding** - when you use color, **also** use another aesthetic (line type, shape, facet, etc.).

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: "This image features a pattern of small shapes scattered across a white background. The shapes are orange triangles and green circles, distributed randomly throughout the image. The triangles and circles do not overlap and are spaced unevenly, creating a dispersed, non-repetitive pattern. The image appears to represent a simple, abstract design with two distinct shapes and colors."

knitr::include_graphics("images/double.png")
```

## Color Guidelines

**To make your graphic color deficiency friendly...**
  
+ with a unidirectional scale (e.g., all + values), use a **monochromatic** color gradient.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: "This image features a horizontal gradient transitioning smoothly from light to dark blue. On the left side, the gradient starts with a very light, almost white blue and gradually deepens in color, moving through medium blue tones in the center, and finally ending with a deep, dark blue on the right side. The gradient creates a seamless transition across the spectrum of blue hues, visually representing the full range of the color from light to dark."

knitr::include_graphics("images/blues.png")
```

+ with a bidirectional scale (e.g., + and - values), use a **purple-white-orange** color gradient. Transition through white!

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-alt: "This image features a horizontal gradient transitioning between two different color families. On the left side, the gradient starts with a deep purple and gradually lightens to a pale lavender near the center. The gradient then transitions to white in the middle, which serves as a dividing point between the two color families. From the center to the right, the gradient shifts into warm tones, moving from a light peach to a deeper orange, and finally ending with a rich brown on the far right. This gradient smoothly blends the cool purples with the warm oranges, creating a balanced and visually appealing transition between the two color spectrums."

knitr::include_graphics("images/PuOr.png")
```


## Color Guidelines

**To make your graphic color deficiency friendly...**

+ print your chart out in black and white -- if you can still read it, it will be safe for all users.

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "This image is a bar chart titled 'How Often Teens Say They Use Each Platform,' depicting the frequency of usage of various social media platforms by teenagers. The platforms listed from top to bottom are YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. Each platform's usage is broken down into six categories, represented as different segments in the bar: Almost constantly (dark blue), Several times a day (medium blue), About once a day (light blue), Less often (lightest blue), Don’t use (gray)."

## Color in ggplot2

There are several packages with color scheme options:

+ Rcolorbrewer
+ ggsci
+ viridis
+ wesanderson

These packages have color palettes that are aesthetically pleasing and, in many
cases, color deficiency friendly.

You can also take a look at other [ways to find nice color palettes](https://lisacharlottemuth.com/2016/04/22/Colors-for-DataVis/).


# [Lab 2: Exploring Rodents with ggplot2](../../labs/instructions/lab-2-instructions.qmd) & [Challenge 2: Spicing things up with ggplot2](../../labs/instructions/challenge-2-instructions.qmd)

## Peer Code Review

Starting with Lab 2, your labs **will** have an appearance / code format 
portion. 

- Review the [code formatting guidelines](../../code-review/code-review-guidelines.qmd)
*before* you submit your lab!

- Each week, you will be assigned one of your peer's labs to review their code
formatting.

## On the Use of External Resources...

::: {.small}
Part of learning to program is learning from a variety of resources. Thus, I
expect you will use resources that you find on the internet. 

In this class the assumed knowledge is the course materials, including the
course textbook, coursework pages, and course slides. Any functions / code used
outside of these materials require direct references.
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
- If you used Google: 
  + paste the link to the resource in a code comment next to where you used that
  resource

- If you used ChatGPT: 
  + indicate somewhere in the problem that you used ChatGPT
  + paste the link to your chat (using the Share button from ChatGPT)
:::

<!-- Additionally, you are permitted and encouraged to work with your peers as you -->
<!-- complete lab assignments, but **you are expected to do your own work**. Copying -->
<!-- from each other is cheating, and letting people copy from you is also cheating. -->
<!-- Please don't do either of those things. -->

## Things You Should Know About ChatGPT...

. . .

::: {.small}
- GPT uses machine learning to predict what words to give you
  + This method is entirely probabilistic, meaning, the same question may
  produce different answers for different people.
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
- The answers GPT gives rely a lot on the context you provide (or don't provide)
  + It is good to give lots of background information (e.g., what R package you
  are using)
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
- ChatGPT is a pretty decent tutor.
  + Did you use GPT to help you with some code? 
  + Do you not understand what the code is doing?
  + Ask GPT to explain code to you!
