# Creativity in Tables

## Think about Font

![](images/tab-with-different-fonts.png){fig-alt="A table of proportions of correctly returned babies (from last week's lab assignment on simulating data). The table uses times new roman (a serif) font for the title and calibri (a sanserif font) for the body. The use of different fonts in different places makes the table less visually appealing."}

## Make Your Font Consistent

![](images/tab-with-same-font.png){fig-alt="A table of proportions of correctly returned babies (from last week's lab assignment on simulating data). The table uses calibri (a san serif font) for both the title of the table and the body of the table. The use of a consistent font makes the table more visually appealing."}

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
# San serif fonts (e.g., calibri, arial) are more accessible than serif fonts (e.g., times new roman).

## Modification to Learning Targets

</br>

None of the lab assignments had a setting where a `full_join()` was appropriate.

> Remove the `full_join()` section of your `reflection_template.qmd` file

## When locating code...

-   find 1-2 **high quality** examples (quality \> quantity)
-   find examples that hit on **multiple** learning targets at the same time

## For example...

::: {.small}
the code below could be used to demonstrate proficiency
with:

- PE-2 (writing functions)
- R-2 (well documented code)
- DSSM-1 (simulating data)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: example-student-code
#| code-line-numbers: false

randomBabies <- function(nBabies) {
  # Create a vector representing the parents
  parents <- 1:nBabies
  
  # Shuffle the babies randomly
  babies <- sample(parents)
  
  # Count how many babies are correctly returned
  sum(parents == babies)
}
```

# Creativity

. . .

Here are some places where you can demonstrate creativity in a visualization:

- colors
- removing a legend 
  * (annotations or colors in title)
- non-standard plot layout
  * **not** non-standard plots (e.g., heatmaps)

# Creativity

. . .

Here are some places where you can demonstrate creativity in a table:

- font
- shading
- border
- table title / subtitle
- spanner labels
- footnotes / source notes

# Revising Your Thinking

## "Includes thoughtful reflections on why revisions are being requested."

> Feel free to include reflections you are proud of! 

# Extending Your Thinking

> You are making an argument about how you have extended your 
> thinking---"pushing yourself" looks different for everyone, but you need 
> to justify why your code went above and beyond. 

# Determining Your Grade

## Determining Your Grade

> I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an __.

. . .

Your goal is to argue, convincingly and with concrete evidence, that you have
met the criteria for both content proficiency, evidence of continued learning, 
and growth as a team member that goes with a particular grade. 

## Plus / Minus Modifiers

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
**+**

- You’ve met all the criteria for the letter grade along with a significant
amount, but not all, of the criteria for the next letter grade up. 
:::
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
**-** 

- You have met the requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you
believe is a bare minimum. 
- You’ve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except for a small
number of minor criteria.

## What if we don't agree?

There are two ways this might happen.


::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
:::{.fragment}
::: {.small}
***You ask for a grade that is higher than the evidence supports.***

</br>

::: {.fragment}
That is, you grade yourself too highly. For example, you believe you earned an A
in the course, but I do not feel the evidence you’ve provided supports this
grade.

</br>

::: {.fragment}
In this case, I’ll ask you to explain how you would modify a portion of the 
code you've included in your portfolio to be more efficient.

::: {.column width="4%"}

::: {.column width="48%"}

</br>
</br> 

::: {.small}
::: {.fragment}
If your response communicates that you understand this key concept, I will award
you the grade you proposed. 
:::

</br> 
</br> 

::: {.fragment}
If your response communicates that you **do not** understand this key concept, I 
will award you the highest grade I believe the evidence in your portfolio 
supports. 
:::
:::
:::
:::

## What if we don't agree?

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.small}
***You ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates.***
:::

</br>

:::{.fragment}
::: {.small}
That is, you "lowball" yourself, for example you say you earned a B+ when in 
fact I think you earned an A-.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

</br>
</br>
</br>

::: {.fragment}
::: {.small}
In this case, I will tell you what grade I believe you have earned and why.

## Final Portfolio Deadline

The link to your Final Portfolio repository is due by Sunday at 11:59pm. 

::: {.callout-warning}
# Deadline extensions will not be accepted. 

If you do not submit a Final Portfolio by the deadline, [I will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.](https://atheobold.github.io/groupworthy-data-science/portfolio/portfolio-instructions.html#q-what-if-you-do-not-submit-a-final-portfolio)
