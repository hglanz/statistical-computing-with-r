# Lab 4

## Common Mishaps

::: {.incremental}
::: {.small}
- **Q1**: Who collected these data? When were the data collected?
- **Q4**: Column titles of `2008` and `2018` are not descriptive! 
    + Creating column names that **describe** the values stored in those columns!
    + The `names_prefix = ` argument to `pivot_wider()` can help you make better column names! 
    + DVS-6: I can create tables which make my summaries clear to the reader
- **Q4**: Unless you specify `.groups = "drop"` within `summarize()` your table 
still is grouped! 
    + `group_by()` + `summarize()` only drops the first group. 
    + If you have two variables inside `group_by()`, then the data will still 
    be grouped by the second variable!
- **Q7**: The data description contains important information! 
    + `mc_toddler` -- Aggregated weekly, full-time **median** price charged for
    Center-based Care for toddlers.
    + `mhi_2018` -- **Median** household income expressed in 2018 dollars.

## Recreating the Plot

> DVS-2: I use plot modifications to make my visualizations clearer to the
> reader

::: {.small}
- Facets ordered based on developmental stage **not** alphabetically
- Ordering colors in the legend so they appear in the same order as the lines
in the plot. 
:::

. . .

> DVS-3: I show creativity in my visualizations

::: {.small}
- Exploring different color themes
    + Personally, I like the `"Accent"` palette from the RColorBrewer package, 
    but you might like others! 
    + Getting 10 colors is hard! I would recommend looking into the 
    `colorRampPalette()` function to get more colors.

## Other "Big Picture" Code Feedback

::: {.small}
> I strongly recommend against nested functions, as they are difficult for
people to understand what your code is doing. Having two lines is not less
efficient and is more readable.

# Midterm Portfolios

## What to Expect

You will create a Midterm Portfolio, with code covering the
learning targets we have covered thus far in the course. 

. . .

- Your code will be pulled from your Lab and Challenge
assignments. 

. . .

- You will write reflections on how you've:
  + revised your thinking
  + extended your thinking
  + supported and collaborated with your peers
  
## Getting Started

::: {.incremental}
1. Follow [these directions](https://scribehow.com/shared/Forking_a_GitHub_Repository__TKGOvrrYQ1GMfYCafxercg) to fork a copy of the [Final Portfolio repository](https://github.com/atheobold/STAT331_portfolio_template). 

2. Clone the repository into RStudio. 

3. Open the `reflection_template.qmd` file and give it a read!

4. Start finding excerpts of code you wrote for the Labs or Challenges that fit each learning target.

# Date + Time Variables

## Why are dates and times tricky?

When parsing dates and times, we have to consider complicating factors like...

-   Daylight Savings Time.
    -   One day a year is 23 hours; one day a year is 25 hours.
    -   Some places use it, some don't.
-   Leap years -- most years have 365 days, some have 366.
-   Time zones.

## `lubridate`

::::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   Convert a date-like variable ("May 8, 1995") to a date or date-time object.

-   Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a date-time object.

-   Convert between time zones.
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The image shows the hex logo for the lubridate R package. The logo is a green hexagon with a stylized calendar in the center. The calendar has a small clock icon overlapping its bottom left corner, symbolizing time-related functions. The text 'lubridate' appears prominently below the calendar icon within the hexagon. Lubridate is commonly used in R for working with date and time data."

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/main/thumbs/lubridate.png?raw=true")
```
:::
:::::

::: callout-note
The `lubridate` package **installs** and **loads** with the `tidyverse`. 
:::

## `date-time` Objects

There are multiple **data types** for dates and times.

-   A date:
    -   `date` or `Date`
-   A date and a time (identifies a unique instant in time):
    -   `dtm`
    -   `POSIXlt` -- stores date-times as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 ("Unix Epoch")
    -   `POSIXct` -- stores date-times as a list with elements for second, minute, hour, day, month, year, etc.

## Creating `date-time` Objects

Create a date from individual components:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

make_date(year = 1995, month = 05, day = 08)
```

## Create a `date-time` Object from a String

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy("August 29, 1991")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

dmy("29-August-1991", 
    tz = "America/Denver")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

dmy_hms("29-August-1991 9:32:12", 
        tz = "America/Denver")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as_datetime("91-08-29", 
            format = "%y-%m-%d")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

parse_datetime("8/29/1991", 
               format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```
:::

## Common Mistake with Dates

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as_datetime(2023-02-6)
```

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

my_date <- 2023-02-6
my_date
```
:::

</br>

::: {.centered}
***What's wrong here?***
:::

<br>

. . .

Make sure you use quotes!

-   2,015 seconds $\approx$ 33.5 minutes

## Extracting `date-time` Components

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

bday <- ymd_hms("1989-01-14 12:03:12", 
                tz = "America/Denver")
bday
```

. . .

</br> 

::::: columns
::: column
::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

year(bday)
month(bday)
day(bday)
```
:::
:::

::: column
::: {.small}
::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

wday(bday)

wday(bday, 
     label = TRUE, 
     abbr = FALSE)
```
:::
:::
:::
:::::

## Subtraction with `date-time` Objects

Doing subtraction gives you a `difftime` object. 

`difftime` objects do not always have the same units -- it depends on the scale of the objects you are working with.

## How old am I?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

today() - mdy(01141989)
```

. . .

</br> 

How long did it take me to type this slide?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

begin <- mdy_hms("10/21/2024 20:40:34")
finish <- mdy_hms("10/21/2024 20:43:11")

finish - begin
```

## Durations and Periods

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Durations** will always give the time span in an **exact number of seconds**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as.duration(
  today() - mdy(01141989)
            )
```

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Periods** will give the time span in more approximate, but **human readable times**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as.period(
  today() - mdy(01141989)
  )
```
:::
:::
:::

## Durations and Periods

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
We can also **add** time to `date-time` objects:

-   `days()`, `years()`, etc. will add a **period** of time.
-   `ddays()`, `dyears()`, etc. will add a **duration** of time.
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.fragment}
Because durations use the **exact** number of seconds to represent days and years, you might get unexpected results. 

</br> 

When is is my 99th birthday?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy(01141989) + years(99)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy(01141989) + dyears(99)
```
:::
:::
:::


## Time Zones...

...are complicated! 

</br> 

Specify time zones in the form:

-   {continent}/{city} -- "America/Denver", "Africa/Nairobi"
-   {ocean}/{city} -- "Pacific/Auckland"

. . .

What time zone does R think I'm in?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

Sys.timezone()
```

## Time Zones

You can change the time zone of a date in two ways:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- ymd_hms("2024-10-24 18:00:00", 
             tz = "Europe/Copenhagen")
```

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
`with_tz()`

::: {.small}
Keeps the instant in time the same, but changes the visual representation.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x |> 
  with_tz()

x |> 
  with_tz(tzone = "Asia/Kolkata")
```
:::
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
`force_tz()`

::: {.small}
Changes the instant in time by forcing a time zone change.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x |> 
  force_tz()

x |> 
  force_tz(tzone = "Asia/Kolkata")
```
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Common Mistake with Dates

When you read data in or create a new date-time object, the default time zone (if not specified) is UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)*.  

. . .

So, make sure you specify your desired time zone!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- mdy("11/20/1993")
tz(x)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- mdy("11/20/1993", 
         tz = "America/Los_Angeles")
tz(x)
```

::: {.small}
*UTC is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)

<!-- Just down the road in Montecito, CA several rare jewels went missing last fall. The jewels were stolen and replaced with fakes, but detectives have not been able to solve the case. They are now calling in a data scientist to help parse their clues. -->

<!-- Unfortunately, the date and time of the jewel heist is not known. You have been hired to crack the case. Use the clues below to discover the thief's identity. -->

## This activity will require knowledge of:

::: {.small}
- Converting time zones
- Extracting components of a date
- Filtering based on date components
- Making intervals of time
- Filtering values that fall into an interval
- Finding the duration between two dates
- Modulus division

## Getting Started

The partner who got the most sleep starts as the Developer (typing
and listening to instructions from the Coder)!

- The Coder **does not type**. 
  * The collaborative editing feature should allow you to track what is being 
  typed. 
- The Developer **only types what they are told to type**. 

## Submission

> Submit the name of the thief to the Canvas Quiz.

- Each person will input the full name of the thief into the PA 5.2 quiz. 
- The person who last occupied the role of Developer will download and submit 
the `PA-5-dates.html` file for the group.
  + Only one submission per group!
